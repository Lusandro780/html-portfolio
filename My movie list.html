<h1>Xavier's Favourite Movies</h1>
<h2>My top 3 movies of all time</h2>
<hr />
<h3>1. The Grand Budapest Hotel</h3>

<p>A Wes Anderson movie, starring Ralph Fiennes. It is quick paced, full of humour, and witty lines. I believe I've seen it 3 times in a row once.</p>

<h3>2. Howl's Moving Castle</h3>

<p>A Hayao Miyazaki animated movie from Studio Ghibli. It is a very wholesome film, with magic, and heartwarming scenes. Adults and children will both find interest in this film. The soundtrack is exceptional.</p>

<h3>3. The Lord of the Ring's Trilogy </h3>

<p> A Peter Jackson movie adapted from J.R.R Tolkien's book of the same name. Cheating a bit by putting a Trilogy here, though I believe that since it is one story it is important to watch them together. The Lord of the Ring's was already a favourite book of mine, and I feel Pter Jackson really made the story and magic come alive. The soundtrack is beautiful, the decor and props are flawless, and each actor really did an amazing job in bringing their character to life.</p>
